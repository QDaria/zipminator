    "# Virtual Environments\n",
    "\n",
    "Prior to any installation it is highly recomended to routinly create a virtual environment. A virtual environment is a tool that allows you to create an isolated Python environment for your project, separate from your system's global Python environment and other Python projects. This means that you can install specific versions of Python packages and dependencies that your project needs without affecting other Python projects or the system's global Python environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Creating a virtual environment is especially useful when you are working on multiple Python projects simultaneously that require different versions of the same package or library. It also allows you to easily switch between different Python versions and dependencies for each project.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a virtual environment also helps you to avoid conflicts with other Python projects or system libraries. It ensures that your project runs on a consistent and isolated environment, which can help to prevent potential bugs and errors caused by incompatible package versions. Buletting some of the benefits of using virtual environments:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Isolation:` Keeps your project dependencies and packages separate from other Python projects and system libraries.\n",
    "- `Consistency:` Ensures that your project runs on a consistent and isolated environment.\n",
    "- `Flexibility:` Allows you to easily switch between different Python versions and dependencies for each project.\n",
    "- `Stability:` Helps to prevent potential bugs and errors caused by incompatible package versions.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a virtual environment called `zenv` with `Python` `3.8` using conda, you can follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open your favourite terminal (check out Hyper ;)) and activate conda environment, if it is not already activated.\n",
    "2. Run the following command to create a new virtual environment with the name zenv and Python 3.8:\n",
    "\n",
    "```lua\n",
    "conda create -n zenv python=3.8\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Once the environment is created, activate it using the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "conda activate zenv\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will activate the `zenv` virtual environment and you should see (zenv) prefix in your terminal prompt.\n",
    "Now you can install and use zipminator library in this virtual environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Installation with pip\n",
    "\n",
    "To install zipminator using pip, run the following command in your terminal:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install zipminator\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "# Installation with conda\n",
    "\n",
    "To install zipminator using conda, run the following command in your terminal:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "conda install -c conda-forge zipminator\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that conda installation will install additional dependencies required by the package, while pip installation assumes that these dependencies are already installed in your system.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exporting a Conda environment\n",
    "\n",
    "To export a Conda environment into a YAML file, you can use the following command in your terminal or Anaconda prompt:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "conda env export --name myenv > environment.yml\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "# Installation with Poetry\n",
    "\n",
    "Installing with Poetry by running the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "poetry add zipminator\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "After that, you can check if the package is installed by running:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "poetry show zipminator\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If the package is installed, you should be able to run zipminator command.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Installation from source\n",
    "\n",
    "To install Zipminator from source, follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "Clone the Zipminator repository from GitHub:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git clone https://github.com/QDaria/zipminator.git\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Navigate to the cloned repository directory:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "cd zipminator\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a virtual environment:\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "python -m venv venv\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Activate the virtual environment:\n",
    "On Windows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "venv\\Scripts\\activate.bat\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "On Unix or Linux:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "source venv/bin/activate\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Install the required dependencies:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install -r requirements.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Install Zipminator using pip:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install .\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Zipminator should now be installed on your system. You can verify the installation by running the tests:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python -m unittest discover tests\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If all tests pass, you are ready to use Zipminator.\n",
