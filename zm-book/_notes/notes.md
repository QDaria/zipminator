Zipminator is also useful for anyone who needs to send or receive large files over email or other file-sharing services. The package includes compliance checks to ensure that files comply with GDPR, CCPA, and HIPAA regulations. It scans files for personal data and flags any data that may violate regulations, and an audit trail is kept to track who has accessed compressed files and when.

Zipminator offers a range of features that simplify and streamline file compression and decompression tasks. Its capabilities include creating zip files from single or multiple files or directories, extracting files from zip files, and deleting extracted files after use. Password protection for zip files ensures that sensitive data is kept secure during transmission or storage.

Zipminator is a powerful and flexible tool for protecting sensitive data and ensuring compliance with data privacy regulations. The package can be used as a Python library or from the command line, making it easy to integrate with other Python projects or automate the compression and decompression of files. It supports various compression algorithms, including ZIP_DEFLATED, LZMA, and BZIP2, and multiple encryption algorithms, including AES, Blowfish, and RSA.

Zipminator includes features for masking sensitive columns, enabling users to hide specific information in a file, such as social security numbers, email addresses, or phone numbers. The package also supports anonymization of sensitive data, allowing users to remove personal identifying information from a file using techniques such as hashing, pseudonymization, and data suppression.

Finally, Zipminator includes a self-destruct feature that automatically deletes compressed files after a specified period. This ensures that files are only available for a limited time, providing an extra layer of security. To ensure that files are not accidentally deleted, the package includes a confirmation prompt that requires users to enter a password before deleting files. The package also includes a feature that allows users to set a password for compressed files, ensuring that only authorized users can access the files.

To summarize the key features of Zipminator:

- Create zip files from single or multiple files or directories
- Extract files from zip files
- Delete extracted files after use
- Password protection for zip files
- Support for various compression algorithms, including ZIP_DEFLATED, LZMA, and BZIP2
